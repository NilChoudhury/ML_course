# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project

A comprehensive machine learning project that demonstrates two fundamental classification algorithms on the famous Iris dataset. This project is perfect for beginners who want to understand how machine learning works in practice.

## 📊 About the Dataset

The **Iris dataset** is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and statistics. It contains:

- **150 samples** of iris flowers
- **4 features** (measurements in centimeters):
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width  
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
- **3 species** (50 samples each):
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica

This dataset is perfect for learning because it's:
- ✅ Small and manageable
- ✅ Well-balanced (equal samples per class)
- ✅ Real-world data
- ✅ Easy to visualize and understand

## 🤖 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Decision Tree Classifier
**What it does:** Creates a tree-like model of decisions to classify flowers

**How it works:**
- Asks a series of yes/no questions about flower measurements
- Each question splits the data into smaller groups
- Continues until it can confidently identify the species
- Example: "Is petal length > 2.5cm?" → Yes → "Is petal width > 1.7cm?" → No → "Setosa"

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 **Accuracy:** 93.33%
- 📊 **Interpretable:** You can see exactly how decisions are made
- 🚀 **Fast:** Makes predictions instantly
- 📈 **Feature Importance:** Shows which measurements matter most

**Results:**
- Perfect classification for Setosa (100% accuracy)
- Very good performance for Versicolor and Virginica (88-93%)
- Most important features: Petal length (54%) and Petal width (46%)

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**What it does:** Classifies flowers by finding the most similar flowers in the training data

**How it works:**
- When given a new flower, finds the k most similar flowers from training data
- Looks at what species those similar flowers belong to
- Makes prediction based on majority vote
- Example: If 5 nearest neighbors are 4 Setosa + 1 Versicolor → Predicts Setosa

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 **Accuracy:** 91.11% (with optimal k=6)
- 🔍 **No assumptions:** Doesn't assume data follows any pattern
- 📊 **Confidence scores:** Shows how certain the prediction is
- ⚖️ **Feature scaling comparison:** Tests with and without data normalization

**Results:**
- Perfect classification for Setosa (100% accuracy)
- Good performance for Versicolor and Virginica
- Some confusion between Versicolor and Virginica (expected - they're similar)
